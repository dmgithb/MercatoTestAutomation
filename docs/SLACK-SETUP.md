## 🎛️ Advanced Configuration

### Custom Channel Configuration

Update the workflow to use different channels for different types of notifications:

```yaml
# Success notifications to general channel
channel: '#test-automation'

# Failure notifications to alerts channel  
channel: '#test-alerts'

# Manual trigger notifications to development channel
channel: '#dev-testing'
```

### Conditional Notifications

Current setup sends notifications for:
- ✅ **Push events** (commits to main branch)
- ✅ **Scheduled runs** (daily/weekly automation)
- ✅ **Manual triggers** (workflow_dispatch)

### Notification Timing

- **Success**: Only when ALL tests pass
- **Failure**: When ANY test suite fails
- **Manual**: Always for manual triggers (regardless of outcome)

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Method 1: Manual Trigger Test
1. Go to GitHub Actions: https://github.com/dmgithb/MercatoTestAutomation/actions
2. Click "Playwright Tests" → "Run workflow"
3. Select:
   - Browser: `chrome`
   - Test Suite: `critical`
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Check your Slack channel for notification

### Method 2: Push Commit Test
```bash
# Make a small change and push
echo "# Test Slack notifications" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: trigger Slack notification"
git push origin main
```

### Method 3: Force Failure Test
Temporarily modify a test to fail and push to see failure notifications.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. **No Notifications Received**
- ✅ Check GitHub Secrets: Ensure `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` exists
- ✅ Verify Webhook URL: Test manually with curl
- ✅ Check Slack App: Ensure webhook is active
- ✅ Review Workflow Logs: Check for error messages

#### 2. **Notifications to Wrong Channel**
- ✅ Verify channel in workflow YAML
- ✅ Check Slack webhook configuration
- ✅ Ensure bot has access to target channel

#### 3. **Missing Information in Notifications**

- ✅ Review conditional logic in YAML

### Debug Commands:

  --data '{"text":"Test from Mercato Automation"}' \
  YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```
